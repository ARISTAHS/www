								<dt>Connor</dt>
								<dd>It is the latest prototype Android RK800 operated directly by Cyberlife, and it is made for various investigation aids and negotiations. Upon receiving orders from Cyberlife, the defective Android was dispatched to identify the root cause of the defect and solve the problem. As mentioned in the movie, it seems to be the first Android model to be put into a police investigation. Among rogue androids with ego, it is infamous as a rogue hunter's corner. At the beginning of the story, it starts as an android, a being for humans and a machine itself that moves as thoroughly programmed, and to Daniel who points a gun at him, he replies, "You can't kill me. I'm not alive."</dd>

								<dt>Markus</dt>
								<dd>Markus is dumped at the Android dump after his father, 'carl', dies. Afterwards, Markus meets rogue androids who are hiding in an abandoned ship called 'Jerico' and insists that they should go out and shout for freedom and lead several operations. However, since the world does not recognize androids as sanctioned and equal, I am contemplating whether to continue nonviolent protests as leaders or complete the revolution by fighting against humans. Watching his comrades who are sacrificed during many operations, Markus is constantly faced with choices that will change the fate of the androids.</dd>

								<dd>When a child named Alice is in danger of being assaulted by her owner, she runs away with the child. With her lack of money, weakness, and nowhere to turn, Kara continues to seek help around her to help her survive the crisis with Alice. As the story progresses, Kara has to take care of her Alice in a situation that becomes more difficult, and she sometimes wonders if she should act selfishly. While she can meet the most diverse sidekicks, Kara's ending changes a lot depending on what happens to the characters around her.</dd>
